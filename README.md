Bio:

I am a software engineer with 14 years of experience in software development from backend systems, website design and implementation and DevOps on Unix/Linux, and I am an expert in Python for data validation and enrichment and UI/UX for the desktop using the Here enterprise browser and the web. My key achievements include reducing QA deal compression debugging time with a React desktop app making a middleware rest microservice that improved the productivity of our QA time by reducing lookup times from minutes to seconds. I also lead a project that would perform same day settlement of deals and ETL of currency trades into backend data lakes. Also, to teach myself new technology trends I have made Securday which is a chatbot that performs network scanning using OpenAI's APIs which was featured at DEF CON which is the largest information security conference.
