Bio:

As a Twitch streamer I communicate to others on how to understand and make software engineering decisions backed by eleven years of experience. I mainly specialize in Python and I have some simple stateless React applications using templates. During my tenure at Bank of America I created a Python micro service application and I adapted an Openfin template given to me to make a request to the ReST service to increase our efficiency in our business analyze and QA team productivity. I also led a same-day settlement system and did more UI improvements using Quartz an Bank of America Python framework for UI , VCS and scheduled tasks. I was a Speaker at DEF CON 31 where I made a network natural language scanner available at securday.com which I also maintain and evaluate its performance.
